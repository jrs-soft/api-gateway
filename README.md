# API Gateway

In the context of Spring Boot and microservices architecture, an API Gateway is a server that acts as an entry point for a set of microservices. It is a key component for managing, securing, and optimizing communication between clients and multiple microservices. The API Gateway consolidates various microservices into a single entry point, providing a unified interface to external clients.

Here are some key responsibilities and features of an API Gateway in the context of Spring Boot and microservices:

Routing: The API Gateway handles incoming requests and routes them to the appropriate microservice based on the requested URI or other criteria. This allows clients to interact with multiple microservices through a single entry point.

Load Balancing: An API Gateway can distribute incoming requests across multiple instances of a microservice to ensure even load distribution and optimal performance.

Security: The API Gateway can enforce security measures such as authentication, authorization, and encryption to protect the microservices and ensure that only authorized users can access certain resources.

Request and Response Transformation: It can transform requests and responses to adapt to the different communication protocols and data formats used by the microservices, providing a standardized interface for clients.

Rate Limiting: An API Gateway can enforce rate limiting to control the number of requests a client can make within a specific time frame, preventing abuse and ensuring fair usage.

Logging and Monitoring: It can collect logs and metrics related to incoming requests, providing insights into the performance and health of the microservices.

Caching: An API Gateway can implement caching mechanisms to store and serve frequently requested data, reducing the load on microservices and improving response times.

Using Spring Cloud, developers can implement an API Gateway within a Spring Boot-based microservices architecture. Spring Cloud Gateway is a popular choice for building API Gateways in the Spring ecosystem, providing features like routing, filtering, and other capabilities needed for managing microservices communication effectively.

# Run the Application

Start your Spring Boot application. This will launch the API Gateway on port 8080.

Testing:
You can now send requests to the API Gateway. For example, if you have a service running on http://localhost:8081/example/resource, you can access it through the API Gateway at http://localhost:8080/example/resource.

## Running the API Gateway with Docker Compose

To simplify the deployment of the API Gateway and related services, you can use Docker Compose. Follow these steps to start the API Gateway using `docker-compose`:

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure that you have [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) installed on your system.

### Starting the API Gateway

1. Navigate to the `compose` directory of your project:

   ```shell
   cd compose
   ```

2. Open the `docker-compose.yml` file in a text editor and ensure that it defines the services and configurations required for your API Gateway. Make any necessary adjustments based on your specific project requirements.

3. Run the following command to start the API Gateway and associated services in detached mode with the project name "houses96-api-gateway":

   ```shell
   docker-compose -p houses96-api-gateway up -d
   ```

   This command will create and start Docker containers for the API Gateway and any linked microservices defined in the `docker-compose.yml` file.

4. The API Gateway and related services will start, and you can monitor their status by running:

   ```shell
   docker-compose -p houses96-api-gateway ps
   ```

   This command will display the status of the running containers.

### Testing the API Gateway

You can now test the API Gateway by sending requests to it. For example, if you have a service running on http://localhost:8081/example/resource, you can access it through the API Gateway at http://localhost:8080/example/resource.

Feel free to customize the steps and instructions to match the specifics of your project and Docker Compose configuration. Using Docker Compose simplifies the management of your API Gateway and related services, making it easier to deploy and test in a controlled environment.
