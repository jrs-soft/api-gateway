# API Gateway

Run the Application:
Start your Spring Boot application. This will launch the API Gateway on port 8080.

Testing:
You can now send requests to the API Gateway. For example, if you have a service running on http://localhost:8081/example/resource, you can access it through the API Gateway at http://localhost:8080/example/resource.
